# zens_first_test
A repository which stores the implementation of the requirements in the given intern first test of ZenS
The UI will have 2 main parts:
1. Display a list of 5 integers and the result of sum min and sum max of 4 of those integers
   (all 5 integers will be randomly generated each time the app is opened)
2. Display a joke and 2 buttons to vote and down-vote for the joke
3. I used BLoC to manage the state of the app
4. Product's images:
