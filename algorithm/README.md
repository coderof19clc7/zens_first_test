## How I solve the problem
To solve the required algorithmic problem, I did the following steps:
1. Generate a list of 5 integers between 0 and 1000.
2. Print the list (just to see the input).
3. Call function miniMaxSum() with the list as parameter.
4. Implement the miniMaxSum function:
   - Prepare 3 variables: min, max and sum (all initial values are 0).
   - Make 1 for loop through the list to find min value, max value and the sum.
   - Print the min sum is the result of sum minus max value and max sum is the result of sum minus min value.

## The code is implemented in bin/algorithm.dart file
